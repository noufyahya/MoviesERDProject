# MoviesERDProject
Built an ETL pipeline that extracted raw Netflix data from CSV, transformed it through data cleaning and normalization (handling multi-valued attributes like cast, genres, and countries), and loaded it into a relational database (SQLite). Designed an ERD and implemented SQL queries to generate insights.
