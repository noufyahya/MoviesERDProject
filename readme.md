### Objective

The purpose of this project is to show my abilities to do ERDs and make databases from scratch, it's also to show my ability to deal with the ETL pipline, this .

### Start

I took a flat CSV file from Kaggle, I then decided to transform it to a relational database, this helped me discover the entities and relationships between them that arn't obvious in a flat file, the ERD made the data sensible for a human rather than looking at a flat file, it is also a first step towards a normalized dataset.

<!-- not just abt erd , it's also about ETL pipelines -->

### ETL pipline

Extract = read Netflix CSV with pandas.

Transform = clean, normalize, split multi-valued attributes.

Load = insert into SQLite database tables according to your ERD.

### Issues Faced

int -> integer

**duplicates**
I ran into the issue of having 86728 countries instead of only 100 ~ 200 unique countries, this happened because for every row, i inserted a new entry instead of checking if the country existed first and reusing the old one, this issue happened because of a mistake in my logic that was in every other table as well.
solution:
I deleted the orignal mess first, then made a list of unique items by using the set function which doesn't allow duplicates, then inserted them into the DB.

### Lessons learnt

-talk abt why you shows python instead of SQL
how it helps you understand developers better and to show the data flow
